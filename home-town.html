                        the region. It is one of the most popular
                        tourist
                        attractions in Kerala. The city is located in the

                        Situated on the south-western coast of India, Alappuzha
                        is also known by its anglicized name
                        Alleppey. Gifted with immense natural beauty,
                        Alappuzha’s backwaters have been the mainstay of
                        Kerala’s tourism. Alappuzha port used to be one of the
                        busiest trade centers and traded with the
                        Persian Gulf regions and even Europe. Close to Alappuzha
                        lies Kuttanad, the ‘Granary of Kerala’,
                        where farming is done below sea level.

                    <hr class="h2-u">
                    <p>
                        In early 20th Century, the then British Viceroy Lord
                        Curzon, while visiting Alappuzha, was
                        fascinated by its scenic beauty and declared it as the
                        Venice of the East. Alappuzha, whose
                        foundations were laid by Travancore’s Dewan Raja Kesava
                        Das in the second half of 18th century, had
                        trade relations with ancient Greece and Rome. Even
                        travelers like Pliny and Ptolemy have mentioned
                        about places in Alappuzha in their works. It was because
                        of the efforts and foresight of Raja Kesava
                        Das, who constructed roads and canals to improve
                        transportation, that Alappuzha became a premier
                        port town.

                            Alappuzha is a non-vegetarian’s paradise. Prawns,

                            varieties of sea fish besides Karimeen (Pearlspot)
