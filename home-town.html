                <hr class="h2-u">
                <p>Alappuzha is a city in Kerala, India. It is the administrative headquarters of the Alappuzha
                    district.
                    Alappuzha is considered as the oldest planned city in the region. It is one of the most popular
                    tourist
                    attractions in Kerala. The city is located in the coastal region of Laccadive Sea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Situated on the south-western coast of India, Alappuzha is also known by its anglicized name
                    Alleppey. Gifted with immense natural beauty, Alappuzha’s backwaters have been the mainstay of
                    Kerala’s tourism. Alappuzha port used to be one of the busiest trade centers and traded with the
                    Persian Gulf regions and even Europe. Close to Alappuzha lies Kuttanad, the ‘Granary of Kerala’,
                    where farming is done below sea level.

                <p>
                    In early 20th Century, the then British Viceroy Lord Curzon, while visiting Alappuzha, was
                    fascinated by its scenic beauty and declared it as the Venice of the East. Alappuzha, whose
                    foundations were laid by Travancore’s Dewan Raja Kesava Das in the second half of 18th century, had
                    trade relations with ancient Greece and Rome. Even travelers like Pliny and Ptolemy have mentioned
                    about places in Alappuzha in their works. It was because of the efforts and foresight of Raja Kesava
                    Das, who constructed roads and canals to improve transportation, that Alappuzha became a premier
                    port town.

                        Alleppey, apart from its embrace of common Indian festivals, also reveres and celebrates
                        traditional
                        Kerala festivals, with Onam and Ugadi being among the most prominent. Onam, the grandest of
                        Kerala's festivals, occurs during the month of Chingam in the Malayali calendar, usually
                        aligning with August or September in the Gregorian calendar.

                        This festival commemorates the return of King
                        Mahabali, showcasing spectacular snake boat races drawing enthusiastic crowds from both
                        residents and
                        tourists alike. These races, an integral part of Alleppey's culture, light up its backwaters
                        during the

                        The best time to visit Alleppey is between October and February when the temperature is moderate

                        and the offbeat travellers can consider visiting in June.
